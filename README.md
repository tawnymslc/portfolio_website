## Tawny's Portfolio Website

A full-stack developer portfolio showcasing integrations with Web3 and fintech APIs. Originally developed during my Nucamp full-stack bootcamp, this project continues to evolve as I incorporate new technologies and features.

## About The App

My portfolio site serves as a platform to demonstrate my full-stack development skills. The application integrates various APIs to provide dynamic content and functionality, including domain search, payment processing, and news content display.

## Current Integrations

Unstoppable Domains Partner API: Allows users to search for available Web3 domains. Utilizes the Partner API to fetch domain suggestions based on user input, displaying domain names and pricing information. ​
Unstoppable Domains Developer Portal

Stripe Payment API: Implements a mock payment flow using Stripe's API and CardElement within a React modal. Users can simulate domain purchases using test card details (e.g., 4242 4242 4242 4242). ​

News Site Section: Built with Bootstrap components such as cards, rows, and navigation elements to showcase structured content and responsive design. 

## Future Integrations

ETL Dashboard (in progress): Developing a dashboard that extracts data from APIs, transforms it, and loads it for visualization and analysis.

Login with Unstoppable: Implementing decentralized authentication using Unstoppable Domains. ​

Unstoppable Resolution: Adding domain resolution features to map human-readable names to crypto addresses. ​
